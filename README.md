## Features

- A static site responsive on all screen sizes and devices.
  - 10 styled pages.
- A consistent header and footer on each page.
- Correct links to all of Kuleana Coral's social media pages.
- A form page with a styled form-processing PHP page.
- The usage of CSS Box Model, CSS FlexBox, and CSS Grid.

## Featured Addition

THIS Addtion is 'featured' because it is a choice the non-profit can make to implement or not.

- On the home page, you can switch the nav bar style between the traditional dropdown menu, and a modern hamburger menu.
- The hamburger icon and animation occurs opun clicking the icon, bringing up the navigation menu.
- The animation works while toggling on or off.
- Kuleana Coral can choose which navigation style they would like to be implemented.

NOTE: The Hamburger Menu is only included on the Home Page for development purposes.
If it is chosen to be the final navigation style, it can easy be applied to the entire site.

## Additions

- On the 'Education' page, an animation is added when hovering over any program cards.
- Text color changed blue to clearly display what is the current page.
- A small animation and text color change occurs when hovering over any navigation item.
- Made all buttons more interactive.
- Hovering over any social media icon, will change the icon color to match the platform's uniform colors.
- Added a styled form processing page that displays the user's name and a message saying we will get back to you soon.
- Improved the responsiveness of the 'Our Story' page by creating a box to surround the text of the page when in tablet or mobile view.
- On the 'Coastal Resilience' page, the video is optimized and controls have been turned off.
- Optimized all images used in the current site.
- All CSS stylesheets have been 'minified'.
